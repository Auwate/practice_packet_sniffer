# Introduction

This is a simple implementation of a packet sniffer for getting hands-on experience with network programming. It uses Python's built in socket and struct libraries to collect and analyze frames coming in through layer 2 (Ethernet frames). Overall, this taught me a variety of concepts related to network programming, such as the OSI model, TCP/IP model, Ethernet frames, IPv4 packets, Python's struct and socket libraries, and using WSL to launch a Debian system on VSCode.
